## What?
This is a reference guide on how to use **GitHub for _non-technical people_**.

It is intended for people who will not be adding _code_ to GitHub but want to know how to
track a project's progress and **will be contributing mainly through _issues_**.

## Why?
At dwyl, **we use GitHub to manage all our projects**.

We like to have a _'single version of the truth'_ where all communication happens in one place (rather than across email, chat systems, a project management tool, GitHub, etc).

Doing this means:
+ Everyone knows exactly where to look for _any_ information on the project
+ Information is always up to date
+ Communications are transparent to the whole team
+ Progress is clear to the _whole_ team
+ There is a _full history/audit_ which anyone can access

We've created this reference guide to provide people who are not developers (and therefore less used to using GitHub) with the essential information they need to be able to **follow the progress of a project**, understand what they're seeing and **participate in the conversation**.


## How?

Some sections here are *intended* to be a walkthrough. Feel free to explore Github while *following along* with the guide!

### How to sign up

Go to https://github.com and click 'Sign Up' in the top right! <img width="350" alt="sign-up-box" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653686/8ca8713c-c5e8-11e5-9f9b-e37fa49f7d58.png">

Enter your **username**, **email address** and **password** to create an account.

Then choose the **free tier**, which will be *selected by default* <img width="500" alt="free-tier" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653664/801f1998-c5e8-11e5-8064-70be739a2d74.png">

...and then you'll **officially be a Github user!**

Next, you'll have to **verify your email address** otherwise you will not be allowed to *create* or *comment on* issues (which we'll come to later). You *should* have received an email to **verify your email address**, but if not, do the following:

Click on your profile picture in the **top-right** of the screen:

  <img width="400" alt="user-menu" src="https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/settings/userbar-account-settings.png">

In the left sidebar, click **Emails**:   <img width="400" alt="emails" src="https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/settings/settings-sidebar-emails.png">

**Next** to your email address, click **Send verification email**. Now you should have an email sitting in your inbox where you can **verify** your email address!

**NOTE**: Github often updates, so in this instance you may *only have to add a new email* under the **Emails** section and you will automatically receive a verification link.  

#### What is an organisation?

Let's start busting some of the *tech jargon* on Github. An **organisation** represents a *group of people* working together, like a company or a collaborative project. For example, [dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl)!

<img width="900" alt="dwyl-organisation" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653662/7de7655e-c5e8-11e5-8556-9efa007d5d48.png">

#### What is a repo?

A **repo**, which is short for **repository**, is a directory or storage space for a project. It can be contained in a folder on your computer, or it can be kept on GitHub. You can keep code files, text files, image files or **any other type of file** inside a repository.

To **get into a repo**, you can browse an organisation's repos on the **organisation** page shown above. Alternatively, you can search for them in the **search bar** which is also shown above and here.

<img width="650" alt="repo-search-bar" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653678/896df582-c5e8-11e5-9708-8b85750c7186.png">

Once you're on the **repo page**, you can **scroll down** to find the **readme**. A **readme** is a document which should contain a great deal of the information concerning a project: **What** the project is for, **Why** it is being worked on, **Who** is working on it, **How** to run the program and **how** you can contribute, and so on. You're reading this repo's **readme** right now!

You *may* be wondering where you can find the **code** on a repo. There isn't any code on *this particular* repo, but if you browse through the repos found on the *dwyl* organisation page, you will find repos which hold a lot of code, like this one:

 <img width="900" alt="repo-with-code" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653661/7b982180-c5e8-11e5-8d19-33a5905bc025.png">

The code can be found in folders like **lib** (short for library), **public** and **styles**. Files with code in them will typically end with **.js** for Javascript, **.html** for HTML and **.css** for CSS, amongst others.

For some of the **terminology** you may find while looking at the repo, have a look at our [terminology section](#terminology).

#### Issues

Issues are **how a team will track their tasks** for the current [sprint](http://scrummethodology.com/scrum-sprint/),
store ideas for future features and log any [bugs](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24864/software-bug-) that they find which need fixing.

To **access** a project's issues, click the **Issues** tab which is shown immediately below the **repository name**:

 <img width="700" alt="issues-tab" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653683/8b27bd2c-c5e8-11e5-83f1-9f113ec1c983.png">

By default you will now see a list of the repo's **open** issues. When you create an issue, it is treated as **open**, and is only **closed** when the team or individual who **created** the issue feel it has been adequately addressed.

When looking at the list of **open** issues, you will be able to see the **titles** of the issues, **who** opened them, **when** they opened them, who is **assigned** to them, as well as what **labels** are attached to the issue. **Labels** are a handy way of organising groups of issues and identifying the *subject* and *content* of an issue - e.g. **question** or **enhancement**.

To **create a new issue**, click on the **New Issue button** on the top right of the **Issues** page

<img width="350" alt="new-issue" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653672/84e0a910-c5e8-11e5-8fe0-300bf339e76b.png">

Here you'll be able to specify *details* about an issue, give the issue a *label*, and *assign* the issue to a project collaborator (or yourself!).

 If you click on an **existing issue**, you can expect to see *comments* from various collaborators, *references* to other *issues*, as well as references to previous *commits* and *pull-requests* (see [terminology section!](#terminology)). Everything within an issue is tracked in **real-time**, and you can add and remove **labels**, which we mentioned above.

##### Tips for participating on issues

*Within* an issue, as we mentioned above, it is possible to reference other issues. When viewing a **list** of issues, you will see the **issue number** alongside a *hashtag* (#), immediately underneath the issue title:

<img width="700" alt="issue-number" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653668/8383ba30-c5e8-11e5-9d68-d7ffdba1d9cd.png">

When you're **within** an issue, the **issue number** can be seen *next to* or *under* the **title** of the issue.

<img width="600" alt="issue-number-on-issue" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653666/81f1e3ae-c5e8-11e5-8cde-2648868159b1.png">

So, you can *cite* this **issue number** within an issue to reference *another* issue, like so!

<img width="500" alt="referencedIssue" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653674/86465566-c5e8-11e5-9cbe-0d489ee8030f.png">

This issue will appear in the other one:

<img width="600" alt="referenced-Issue-Notification" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653676/87d06e1c-c5e8-11e5-90e4-9e390e28b120.png">

Additionally, you can **mention** someone in an issue comment, by typing an at-sign (@), followed by their Github **username**, to notify them, as shown here:

<img width="500" alt="at-someone" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12653688/8df70580-c5e8-11e5-904f-1b1d79d2fb1f.png">

We *love* using Github issues for project management, and we're conscious the above is a **lot** to take in, so perhaps [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlYiMp8FuY) will help clarify the issues interface, and help to visualise *what* is going on within the issues section, and *why* it can be so useful.

**NOTE**: This is a slightly old video so the User Interface is *not* the same as the current one. Most of the functionality is still very similar though.

#### Notifications

When some activity occurs on a repository you're involved in (or one  you're watching), such as a **new issue being raised**, a **new pull request**, or a **mention** (@your-username) in an issue comment, you will get a notification by *email* and / or *web*, depending on your notification settings.

Your **email notifications** will appear in your inbox, and your **web notifications** will appear on your notifications page found here: https://github.com/notifications. You can reach this page by clicking the **bell** on the **top right** of your page.

If you're not currently **watching** a repo, you can choose to watch it by clicking the **watch** button at the top of the repo.

<img width="600" alt="watch-button" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13098199/12655013/be149c86-c5ee-11e5-98c8-dbfc3f6238f1.png">

This will register you to receive notifications when there's new **activity** on the repo, as specified above.

You can manage your notifications settings here: https://github.com/settings/notifications. Here you can specify whether you'd like to receive **email notifications**, what email to receive **email notifications** on, and you can toggle **automatic watching**.

#### Terminology

We understand there are some *techie* words used above, so hopefully these definitions will help clarify them! You will *likely* come across these terms when you begin exploring repositories.

**Commits** - This is the command that makes Github really powerful *and* useful. When a developer makes a commit, they are taking a **snapshot** of their work at that exact point in time, giving them a checkpoint to which they can restore their work to at any future time.

**Branches** - This is a facility which allows for **multiple people** to work on a project at the same time without confusion over version control. Developers **branch off** the current version of the project and make their own changes. When they're finished making changes, they can **merge** that branch back with the main project branch, which will then be the most **up-to-date** version.

**Pull Requests** - This is the method which enables the **merging** of changes from one branch into another. When a developer is ready to merge changes he or she will **open a pull request**, which is a chance for collaborators to review the changes and approve the changes to the project.
